# Life Expectancy - Educational Attainment - 2025

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate life expectancy estimates in the United States by county, year, age, sex, and educational attainment as reported in 'Life expectancy by county and educational attainment in the USA, 2000â€“19: a systematic analysis of health disparities' published in The Lancet on January 23, 2025. 

This repo contains five directories:

1) cod_database contains code that processes raw deaths data, performing various adjustments and redistributing deaths that do not have usable ICD codes. 
2) covariates contains code to generate various covariates used in the modeling process.
3) mortality contains code to model mortality rates using the prepared deaths and population data.
4) population contains code to generate population by county, year, age, sex, race, and ethnicity.
5) sae.shared contains code to generate life expectancy, as well as shared tools, scripts, and related utilities for modeling.
