# do not want all-race pop, we want by-race pop, so that we get by-race growth
# rates. This function will then take the weighted mean, weighted by
# race/ethnicity, to compute all-race averages. In this way, we don't get
# identical growth rates repeated across all counties. Each county will have a
# unique value, according to the racial/ethnic composition of the county.
